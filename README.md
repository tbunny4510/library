Small Library Project

This is just a small library project from The Odin Project.

It is a very simple "library" of books, including:
Book Title
Book Author
Total Pages
Whether Read or Unread

There is no back-end to this, so there is currently no way to save, either
locally or to a server, hence "no back-end"!!

I forgot to set up the github repo until after I finished with the layout
design and styling, so the commit history will be somewhat atrocious.
